# Crime Data Analysis and Classification Project

### Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis and classification of crime data using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the category of crime based on features from a dataset that includes multiple neighborhoods and years.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project, crimedata_csv_AllNeighbourhoods_AllYears.csv, contains crime data across various neighborhoods and years. It includes features such as crime category, neighborhood, year, and other relevant details necessary for building predictive models.

### Objectives

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand distributions, correlations, and identifying patterns.

Model Building: Implementing various classification models to predict crime categories. The models include:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Model Optimization: Utilizing techniques such as GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters and improve model performance.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Key Features

Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 79.6% with hyperparameters optimized using GridSearchCV.

Decision Trees and Random Forests: Provided insights into feature importance and improved prediction accuracy for certain crime categories.

SVM: Demonstrated robust performance with high precision and recall for specific crime types.

### Results

Logistic Regression: Showed balanced performance with notable precision in predicting theft and vehicle collision categories.

Model Evaluation: Detailed classification reports and confusion matrices for each model, highlighting strengths and weaknesses in predicting different crime categories.
